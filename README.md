1.Logistic Regression – Binary Classification Practice
Overview

This repository contains a simple machine learning notebook created while learning Logistic Regression.
The goal of this project is to understand the end-to-end ML workflow for a binary classification problem, including preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

This is a learning-focused exercise, not a production or medical diagnostic system.

Dataset

Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset

Publicly available dataset commonly used for practicing binary classification

Target variable: diagnosis

1 → Malignant

0 → Benign

Objective

Learn how Logistic Regression works in practice

Apply standard preprocessing steps

Train and evaluate a binary classification model

Understand model behavior and outputs

Workflow

Load and inspect the dataset

Remove irrelevant columns

Encode categorical labels

Scale numerical features

Split data into training and testing sets

Train a Logistic Regression model

Evaluate model performance using accuracy

Model Used

Logistic Regression (Scikit-learn)

Chosen for:

Simplicity

Interpretability

Suitability for binary classification

Results

The model achieves reasonable accuracy on the test set.

This result is intended to validate understanding of Logistic Regression rather than optimize performance.

Tools & Libraries

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib / Seaborn (if used)

Notes

This project was built as part of learning machine learning fundamentals.

No advanced tuning, cross-validation, or medical claims are made.

Future improvements could include:

Additional evaluation metrics

Feature importance analysis

Regularization experiments
